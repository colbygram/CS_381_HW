DOECS Implementation: Full marks since the game is built using DOECS

Must be interactable: Full marks. Game is interactable through keyboard and mouse :)

Must Respond to mouse: I don't know the extent of this is required but 
the main menu requires a mouse click to start game

Must Draw Model or play sound: I had tried to get sound to work with music but 
it would not work no matter what. It's a 2D game so models can't be rendered.
I used custom made textures for tiles and drew those to screen, I dont know if 
that counts or not

Custom made: I would say yes since all the textures except the main menu is custom made

Display Text: Yes game displays text in menu and on start button

Description of criterion: this

Window named AS9: with a few extra words too :)

Minimum two systems not proposed in class: I would say yes. My game contains 5 systems.
The physics system and move system technically only require the player since I didn't 
want to apply physics to other entities in the scene, but they still represent 
systems and physics can easilty be extended to include all entities

Additional systems: don't know if my systems count but I have 5

Read me and pictures: read me explains basis of game, controls and has pictures

Grade Myself: I personally believe it's a 110 considering that it isn't just another
coppy paste 3D game and I tried to extend it to a dimension we haven't worked in, in 
this class, containing it's own difficulties.
